# minifb-async-examples
This project can be compiled to webassembly and desktop.
The desktop part is still unfinished, but the idea is to share
the code between both versions so you can test it on a browser
and a desktop.


## How to run in a browser

* make sure you have wasm-pack installed: cargo install wasm-pack
* Run ./build_web.sh on linux to compile and start a demo server.

## How to run in a desktop

* cargo run
