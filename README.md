# minifb-async-examples
Some test projects I used to test minifb in webassembly.

WARNING: the demo project contains flashes. It's a screen toggling from white to black over and over and most likely you will feel dizzy. Don't run the demo if you are sensitive to certain patterns.

Feel free to send a PR to change it for something easier to watch.
